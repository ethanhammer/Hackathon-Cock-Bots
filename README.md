#  CockBots: A Social Media Platform for USC Starship Food Delivery Robots

This project is the result of our efforts at the **2024 Cocky Hackathon**, where we built a unique social media website dedicated to the beloved Starship food delivery robots at the University of South Carolina.

##  Achievements
- **1st Place** - Most Functional Project
- **2nd Place Overall**

##  Project Overview
**CockBots** allows users to create accounts, upload photos of USC's Starship robots, and share their favorite moments. To maintain the focus on our robotic friends, we integrated an AI model trained specifically to recognize and validate the presence of Starship robots in each post.

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP, MySQL
- **AI Integration:** Python (for image recognition)
- **Development Environment:** XAMPP

##  Features
- **User Accounts:** Users can sign up, create profiles, and upload photos.
- **AI-Driven Moderation:** Our AI model ensures that all uploads feature Starship robots.
- **Community Interaction:** Users can view and interact with posts from others in the community.

##  My Role
I was responsible for the website and server-side development, which included:
- **PHP Development:** Writing nearly all of the PHP code for server-side logic.
- **Database Design:** Structuring and managing the MySQL database.
- **Frontend Implementation:** Designing and developing the HTML structure and layout.
